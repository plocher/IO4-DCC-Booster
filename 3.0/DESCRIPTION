IO4-DCC-Booster

Mar, 2017

Corrected several 2.0 limitations
* uC control of out of service LED to account for dual (remote and local) OOS inputs
* Use a N-MosFET instead of a NPN! (2N7002)
* adjusted LCD mount to clear IO4 connector
* reversed DCC command station input phase
* aligned silk screen on back to clear pads/vias
* Added a connector for off-board feedback LEDs (outboard resistors required!)
